## Welcome to my humble abode! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Imani Rojas and this is my page! I really enjoy editing vlogs, watching anime and drawing/painting. 

I am majoring in Graphic Information Technology. I am undecided on what I want to do after graduation but out of courses I've taken so far, I have enjoyed graphic design side of things.

GIT 215 is my first experience with coding but I'm enjoying it. I don't have any skills or experience with coding but I feel like I am catching on to it very quickly.
